In 2017, I knew I wanted something bigger, something that would challenge my mind and push me beyond what I thought was possible. With no prior experience in technology but a burning desire to change my life, I dove headfirst into the unknown. Coming from a family with a background in IT, I received a piece of advice that resonated deeply: ''Learn to code.'' With determination, I invested in a programming logic course with Python. And it was love at first sight. Just one month later, I was already facing my first real challenge: developing a hydrogeological graph generator system. That was the moment I realized I had found my path. Since then, I havenâ€™t stopped. I specialized in backend development with Python and Django, robust APIs, and advanced data modeling and management. I deepened my knowledge in React, advanced styling, authentication, RPA automation, and even artificial intelligence. For me, technology is not just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about solving problems intelligently and making a real impact."
